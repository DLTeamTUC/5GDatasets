# 5GDatasets
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of 5G security datasets, including packet capture (pcap) files, processed CSV datasets, and AMF log screenshots for various attack scenarios. The datasets were generated in controlled testbed environments using Open5GS, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and Amarisoft cores, featuring a mix of flooding attacks, fuzzing attacks, and replay-based attacks on the 5G Control and Data Planes.

Each attack scenario includes:

- Pcap files: Captured network traffic for in-depth protocol analysis.
- CSV files: Processed datasets with labeled malicious and benign traffic samples.
